Balanced Chess
==============

Balanced chess is a project in *node.js* and uses websockets (*socket.io*) to give realtime updates and gameplay.

# Getting Started
First you need to download node.js from http://nodejs.org/download/

Note: Node comes with an awesome package manager called npm. Some useful commands:
* npm list
* npm install 'package'
* npm uninstall 'package'

Currently we have the following packages installed
* __express__ - express is a framework that makes things easy, providing routing, middleware and other nice features.
* __socket.io__ - easy websockets. socket.io first initiates a normal http connection then upgrades to html5 websockets if it can. Has fallbacks for flash sockets etc
* __jade__ - simple lightweight templating engine that we'll be using for a bit of server-side templating.
